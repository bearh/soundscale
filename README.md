soundscale
==========

About:
------

Tech to work the sort of area a device is in based on sound. (As in Ambient computing style ;p)

Quite hard to explain, but it works by judging the frequency of sound and the sort of ranges, etc.

Currently in early stages of dev and progress might be a bit slow as it's a hobby project.

bin/ is for for binaries.

docs/ is for outdated inane info ;p

include/ is all the headers and all that jazz.

The configure file is useless ATM.

Stuff nobody cares for:
-----------------------

Requires PortAudio.

Makefile is setup for OSX. It will EVENTUALY(read: never) be sorted out for more platforms.
